# SWDynamicCenter

Example of vertically centering a view based on its height - in this case, a Table View with the height changing when the number of rows changes.

Note: This is NOT an ideal way to do this, nor is it complete (no error handling / checking / etc). 

It's simply meant to demonstrate some aspects of auto-layout and dynamic constraints.
